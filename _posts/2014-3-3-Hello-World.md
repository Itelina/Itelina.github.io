title: MTA Analysis

Are you a New Yorker who loves your subways?

Even if you don't, you might be wondering - which subway stations are the busiest? How can I avoid smelly subway trains in the early commute hours? 

In this analysis I dug into the MTA turnstile data, and churned out a list of the highest traffic subway stations. I looked into data throughout the weeks of 4/4/2015 to 4/15/2015. You can find the data source here: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html

What I found out was that:

####In the Mornings
People are generally coming in from the outer boroughs to work.

####During Lunch Periods
During lunch hours, there are some people coming into the city (probably for the "2nd" shift). Overall traffic volume is lower compared to the mornings.

####In the Afternoons
People are clearing out of Manhattan and heading back home.

####In the Evenings
Some traffic is coming from people going home on their "second shifts".  Overall traffic volume is lower.

So â€¦ if you want to avoid smelly subway stations during commuting hours ... stay away from the stations above! Especially midtown. 

Happy commuting!!!
